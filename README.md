### "üçï What's for Lunch?" ‚Äì a simple and intuitive online tool for coordinating team lunch orders.

**Problem:** Coordinating lunch orders with colleagues is often chaotic and time-consuming. Teams waste time in chat discussions, struggle to reach consensus on menu choices, and often default to the same items due to decision fatigue.

**Solution:** A web-based lunch voting tool where team members can quickly vote on meal options within a set timeframe. The system helps teams make faster decisions about group lunch orders.

**Simplified cases:** A team needs to quickly decide on lunch options. They create a poll, vote within 30 minutes, and automatically get the winning choice. A team manager can access historical data to analyze lunch patterns and optimize food expenses based on team preferences.
